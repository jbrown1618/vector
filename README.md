# Vector

A linear algebra library written in TypeScript that focuses on generality, extensibility, and ease of use.

## Features

- Basic manipulation of vectors and matrices
- Out-of-the-box support for `number` and `ComplexNumber`
- Extensible to support general scalar types
- Matrix determinants
- Matrix exponentials
- Elementary row operations
- Gauss-Jordan elimination
- Differentiation via finite differences
- Least-Squares Regression for arbitrary model functions
- LU Decomposition
- QR Decomposition
- Eigenvalue / Eigenvector finding
- And more to come!

## Design Priorities

- Generality
- Extensibility
- Ease of use
- Immutability

Notably absent from this list is performance. Better solutions (and languages)
exist for performing heavy linear algebra computations.
