# Vector

A linear algebra library written in TypeScript that focuses on generality, extensibility, and ease of use.

## Features

- Core:
  - Basic manipulation of vectors and matrices
  - Out-of-the-box support for `number` and `ComplexNumber`
  - Extensible to support general scalar types
- Matrix Operations:
  - Matrix determinants
  - Matrix exponentials
  - Elementary row operations
  - Gauss-Jordan elimination
  - Eigenvalue / Eigenvector finding
- Matrix Factorizations:
  - Cholesky Decomposition
  - LU Decomposition
  - QR Decomposition
  - Singular Value Decomposition
- Applications:
  - Calculus: Differentiation via finite differences
  - Statistics: Least-Squares Regression for arbitrary model functions
  - Statistics: Principal component analysis
- Machine learning models
  - Regularized linear regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machines
- And more to come!
