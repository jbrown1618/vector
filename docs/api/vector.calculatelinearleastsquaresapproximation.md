## calculateLinearLeastSquaresApproximation() function

Calculates a linear regression model for the provided `dataPoints`<!-- -->. The result is an object which has:

- `coefficiencts`<!-- -->: a vector whose first entry is the constant term, and whose following entries are the coefficients for the other independent variables, in the same order they appear in the `dataPoints` - `approximationFunction`<!-- -->: a function which takes a vector of the independent variable values, and returns the predicted value of the dependent variable

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function calculateLinearLeastSquaresApproximation<S>(dataPoints: Vector<S>[]): LeastSquaresApproximation<S>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  dataPoints | <code>Vector&lt;S&gt;[]</code> | An array of vectors, each of which represents a single data point where the last entry is the variable to be predicted, and the other entries are the values of the independent variables |

<b>Returns:</b>

`LeastSquaresApproximation<S>`

- the result of the linear regression
