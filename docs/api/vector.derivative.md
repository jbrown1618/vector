## derivative() function

Uses finite differences to build a vector containing approximate values of the derivative of `f`<!-- -->.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function derivative(f: (x: number) => number, xMin: number, xMax: number, binCount: number): Vector;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  f | (x: number) =&gt; number | A deterministic function with no side effects |
|  xMin | number | The minimum value for which the derivative will be approximated |
|  xMax | number | The maximum (exclusive) value for which the derivative will be approximated |
|  binCount | number | The number of approximations |

<b>Returns:</b>

[Vector](./vector.vector.md)

A linearly spaced vector whose values represent the values of the derivative

## Example


```
// Approximates Math.cos at 100 points between 0 and 2*PI
derivative(Math.sin, 0, 2*Math.PI, 100);

```
