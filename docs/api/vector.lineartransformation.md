## LinearTransformation interface

An abstract linear transformation between vectors of type `V` and vectors of type `U`<!-- -->.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export interface LinearTransformation<V, U> 
```

## Methods

|  Method | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [apply(vector)](./vector.lineartransformation.apply.md) | Apply the linear transformation to a vector |

## Remarks

Implementors should take care to ensure that the transformation is linear. That is,

\_T(x + y) = T(x) + T(y)\_

\_T(k \* x) = k \* T(x)\_
