## Norm type

A function that calculates a norm for a vector.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type Norm<S = number> = (v: Vector<S>) => number;
```

## Remarks

A `Norm` should satisfy: - `norm(v)` is greater than 0 when `v` is not the zero vector - `norm(v)` equals 0 when `v` is the zero vector - `norm(k * v)` equals `k * norm(v)` - `norm(v + w)` is less than or equal to `norm(v) + norm(w)` (the triangle inequality)
