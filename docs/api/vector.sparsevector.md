## SparseVector class

Implements [Vector](./vector.vector.md) as a map of indices to nonzero values.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare abstract class SparseVector<S> implements Vector<S> 
```

## Remarks

For large vectors with many entries equal to 0, some operations are more efficient with a [Vector](./vector.vector.md) implementation that only stores the non-zero values.

Subclasses must specify the usual scalar operations on their contents.

The constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or create subclasses that extend the `SparseVector` class.
